# Description 
[Back 2 Books](https://back2books.azurewebsites.net/) is an retro/Y2K-style online shopping site that enables users to buy or sell books. This is our class project, and hopefully a strong point in the 
resume of all of our members. 

This is a class project for the course CS 3773 Software Engineering in the term FALL 2023 at University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA).
